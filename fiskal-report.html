<h1>Fixing Fiscal Compliance Failures Before They Escalate</h1>
<p>A case study in spotting broken integrations, building tooling, and pausing a migration to prevent audit risk.</p>

</div>
<main class="container">
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>
As part of the German hotel system migrations, I was responsible for validating fiscal integrations and supporting technical readiness during hotel onboarding.
I began by reviewing internal documentation on the fiscal setup process within our administrative dashboard, including Linux middleware installation procedures on a property-level server. This also involved studying official TSE documentation to understand the structure of the fiscal interface, signature requirements, and compliance standards under Technical
Guideline BSI TR-03153, KassenSichV / DSFinV-K.
To ensure consistency in implementation, I mapped out a standard operating procedure for fiscal validation during German migrations.
</p>
<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>While on-site at one of the properties, I ran an SQL script on the local database to validate the installation status of the fiscal integration by checking presence or absence of a certain integration type. It was not installed. Upon reviewing a few additional German sites, I recognized a wider pattern and manually confirmed similar gaps.
This prompted development of a  <a href="">tool</a>, which programmatically swept all 40+ German hotel instances for fiscal module status — revealing that 33% had no software installation to work with mandatory fiscal interface.

 I then began reviewing the dedicated property fiscal reports to identify functional or compliance issues, not just uninstalled integration. I reused the powershell script above, replacing the invoked sql command and changed connection to a report database. I uncovered some consistent issues, from signatures not created to transactions not sent to the TSE server, with total amount of non-compliant transactions amounting to millions.
</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>

•   Following escalation, migrations for German region have been temporarily paused, to prevent any potential costly non-compliance issues. 
</p>
<p>
•   I was temporarily assigned to the openings team to deepen my understanding of TSE behavior, resulting in creation of detailed documentation for fiscal processes.
</p>
<p>
•   The tool has since been adopted by our team to use in preparation for German migrations.
